# face-digit-detector

##### Based on Berkeleyâ€™s CS188 Course

## Implemented three classification algorithms for detecting faces and classifying digits
- Perceptron
- Naive Bayes
- MIRA


## Design
 - Train each algorithm and on training data
 - Train on 10%, 20%,...,100% 

## Testing
1. Set of scanned handwritten digit images (0-9)
2. Set of face images with edges already detected
